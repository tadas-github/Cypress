## General Coding Excersises
- Q1: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first 1-7 numbers of the fibonacci sequence, print out the 35th number (9227465) eg. Printing out the 7th number will print out 13.

- Q2: Write a program that checks to see if every number between 1 and 1000 is both larger than 10 and a palindrome (i.e. "Radar") and outputs the numbers that are. You should expect something like the following 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101...
